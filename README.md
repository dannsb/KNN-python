## KNN
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. In KNN, to predict the label of a new data point, the algorithm calculates the distance between the new point and all points in the training dataset. It then selects the K nearest neighbors (the points with the smallest distances). The final label for the new data point is determined by the majority label among these K neighbors in the case of classification, or by averaging their values in regression.
